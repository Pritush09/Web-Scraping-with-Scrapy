# Scrapy Items are a predefined data structure that holds your data. Instead of yielding your scraped data in the form of a dictionary for 
# example, you define a Item schema beforehand in your items.py file and use this schema when scraping data. This enables you to quickly and 
# easily check what structured data you are collecting in your project, it will raise exceptions if you try and create incorrect data with
#  your Item.



# we can also use a serializer if something that was not read by the spyder while saving data to the file to convert it to a proper manner 
# we wanted 

def serialize_price(val):
    return f'Â£ {str(val)}'

    # define the fields for your item here like:
    # name = scrapy.Field()
